## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web3-dashboard.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies (pnpm)
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üéØ Design Decisions

- **Color Scheme**: Chose a dark theme with blue accents to reduce eye strain during extended use
- **Typography**: Used Geist font for its modern, clean aesthetic and excellent readability
- **Spacing**: Implemented a consistent 8px grid system for visual harmony
- **Motion**: Added subtle animations to guide user attention and improve perceived performance

## üñ•Ô∏è Browser Support

üí° **Note**: This is a design showcase. For a production application, additional security measures and error handling would be implemented.


## üì¶ Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages at:

- URL: `https://ChainsQueenEth.github.io/web3dashboard`

Key configuration files:

- `next.config.js` sets `output: 'export'` and conditionally applies `basePath`/`assetPrefix` for production (`/web3dashboard`).
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds with pnpm and publishes `./out` to the `gh-pages` branch.
- `package.json` declares `"packageManager": "pnpm@10"`.

Deploy from local (optional):

```bash
pnpm build
# Static site will be generated in ./out
```

CI/CD via GitHub Actions:

1) Push to `main` ‚Äî workflow builds and publishes to `gh-pages`.
2) In GitHub repo Settings ‚Üí Pages, set Source to `gh-pages` branch, `/ (root)`.

Troubleshooting:

- If assets/links 404 on Pages, ensure the repo name matches `web3dashboard` and that the Pages URL uses the `/web3dashboard` subpath.
- Confirm that `gh-pages` branch contains the exported files and a `.nojekyll` file (created by the workflow with `enable_jekyll: false`).
